<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>

<p>We present a virtual reality (VR) framework for the analysis of whole
human body surface area. Usual methods for determining the whole body
surface area (WBSA) are based on well known formulae, characterized by
large errors when the subject is obese, or belongs to certain
subgroups. For these situations, we believe that a computer vision
approach can overcome these problems and provide a better estimate of
this important body indicator.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using machine learning techniques to design a computer
vision system able to provide a new body indicator that goes beyond
the use of only body weight and height, entails a long and expensive
data acquisition process. A more viable solution is to use a dataset
composed of virtual subjects. Generating a virtual dataset allowed us
to build a population with different characteristics (obese,
underweight, age, gender). However, synthetic data might differ from a
real scenario, typical of the physicianâ€™s clinic. For this reason we
develop a new virtual environment to facilitate the analysis of human
subjects in 3D. This framework can simulate the acquisition process of
a real camera, making it easy to analyze and to create training data
for machine learning algorithms. With this virtual environment, we can
easily simulate the real setup of a clinic, where a subject is
standing in front of a camera, or may assume a different pose with
respect to the camera.</p>

<p>We use this newly designated environment to analyze the whole body
surface area (WBSA). In particular, we show that we can obtain
accurate WBSA estimations with just one view, virtually enabling the
possibility to use inexpensive depth sensors (e.g., the Kinect) for
large scale quantification of the WBSA from a single view 3D map.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Accurate determination of the whole body surface area (WBSA) is a
topic that has been actively studied over the last century. Here, we
use WBSA (as opposed to BSA) to emphasize the fact that we aim at the
accurate estimation of the whole area of the body. From the initial
estimate of Du Bois and Du Bois in 1916.</p>
