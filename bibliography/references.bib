  Abstract                 = {Our aim was to differentiate the screening potential of waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and waist circumference (WC) for adult cardiometabolic risk in people of different nationalities and to compare both with body mass index (BMI). We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for assessing the discriminatory power of anthropometric indices in distinguishing adults with hypertension, type-2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia, metabolic syndrome and general cardiovascular outcomes (CVD). Thirty one papers met the inclusion criteria. Using data on all outcomes, averaged within study group, WHtR had significantly greater discriminatory power compared with BMI. Compared with BMI, WC improved discrimination of adverse outcomes by 3{\%} (P {\textless} 0.05) and WHtR improved discrimination by 4-5{\%} over BMI (P {\textless} 0.01). Most importantly, statistical analysis of the within-study difference in AUC showed WHtR to be significantly better than WC for diabetes, hypertension, CVD and all outcomes (P {\textless} 0.005) in men and women. For the first time, robust statistical evidence from studies involving more than 300 000 adults in several ethnic groups, shows the superiority of WHtR over WC and BMI for detecting cardiometabolic risk factors in both sexes. Waist-to-height ratio should therefore be considered as a screening tool.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce the Wave Kernel Signature (WKS) for characterizing points on non-rigid three-dimensional shapes. The WKS represents the average probability of measuring a quantum mechanical particle at a specific location. By letting vary the energy of the particle, the WKS encodes and separates information from various different Laplace eigenfrequencies. This clear scale separation makes the WKS well suited for a large variety of applications. Both theoretically and in quantitative experiments we demonstrate that the WKS is substantially more discriminative and therefore allows for better feature matching than the commonly used Heat Kernel Signature (HKS). As an application of the WKS in shape analysis we show results on shape matching.},

In statistics and machine learning, the sparsity principle is used to perform model selection---that is, automatically selecting a simple model among a large collection of them. In signal processing, sparse coding consists of representing data with linear combinations of a few dictionary elements. Subsequently, the corresponding tools have been widely adopted by several scientific communities such as neuroscience, bioinformatics, or computer vision. The goal of this monograph is to offer a self-contained view of sparse modeling for visual recognition and image processing. More specifically, we focus on applications where the dictionary is learned and adapted to data, yielding a compact representation that has been successful in various contexts.},

  Abstract                 = {The prescribed dose of anticancer agents is most commonly calculated using body surface area as the only independent variable, and it has been shown that this approach still results in large interpatient variability in drug exposure. Here, we retrospectively assessed the pharmacokinetics of 33 investigational agents tested in phase I trials from 1991 through 2001, as a function of body surface area in 1650 adult cancer patients. Twelve of the drugs were administered orally, 19 were administered intravenously, and two were administered by both routes. Body surface area-based dosing was statistically significantly associated with a reduction in interpatient variability in drug clearance for only five of the 33 agents: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)--paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil/eniluracil, paclitaxel, temozolomide, and troxacitabine. These results do not support the use of body surface area in dose calculations and suggest that alternate dosing strategies should be evaluated. We conclude that body surface area should not be used to determine starting doses of investigational agents in future phase I studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Sachchidananda Banerjee1 and Ashim Kumar Bhattacharya11Department of Physiology, Bikaner Medical College, Bikaner, Rajasthan, IndiaAbstractBody surface area (BSA) was actually measured in 13 Indian Hindu children, of ages varying between 3 and 12 yr, with tape and surface integrator. In 9 out of 13 children the results obtained were lower than the BSA calculated with the weight-height formula of Du Bois and Du Bois. Based on the actual measurements, a new constant for the weight-height formula was obtained and a new equation: surface area, cm2 = weight 0.425 kg x height 0.725 cm x 70, has been suggested for the BSA of Indian children. A nomogram for reading off surface area in metric units based on the above formula was prepared. A significant difference existed between the BSA calculated with the new formula and that of Du Bois and Du Bois.

  Abstract                 = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

A graph of interest points clusters is constructed and we use the matrix of commute times between the different nodes of the graph to obtain a description of their relative arrangement that is robust to large intra class variation. The obtained high dimensional representation is then embedded in a space of lower dimension by exploiting the spectral properties of the graph made of the different images. Classification tasks can be performed in this embedding space. We expose classification and labelling results obtained on three different datasets, including the challenging PASCAL VOC2007 dataset. The performances of our approach compare favorably with the standard bag of features, which is a particular case of our representation.},

The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. Shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Moreover, the shape context leads to a robust score for measuring shape similarity, once shapes are aligned. The shape context descriptor is tolerant to all common shape deformations. As a key advantage no special landmarks or key-points are necessary. It is thus a generic method with applications in object recognition, image registration and point set matching. Using examples involving both handwritten digits and 3D objects, we illustrate its power for object recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of images and shapes has long been the central theme of computer vision. Its importance is increasing rapidly in the field of computer graphics and multimedia communication because it is difficult to process information efficiently without its recognition. In this paper, we propose a new approach for object matching based on a global geodesic measure. The key idea behind our methodology is to represent an object by a probabilistic shape descriptor that measures the global geodesic distance between two arbitrary points on the surface of an object. In contrast to the Euclidean distance which is more suitable for linear spaces, the geodesic distance has the advantage to be able to capture the intrinsic geometric structure of the data. The matching task therefore becomes a one-dimensional comparison problem between probability distributions which is clearly much simpler than comparing three-dimensional structures. Object matching can then be carried out by an information-theoretic dissimilarity measure calculations between geodesic shape distributions, and is additionally computationally efficient and inexpensive.},

Stride parameters (stride length and cadence) are functions of body height, weight, and gender. Previous work has demonstrated effective use of these biometrics for identification and verification of people. In this paper, we show that performance is significantly improved by using height as an additional discriminant feature. Height is estimated by robustly segmenting the person from the background and fitting their apparent height to a time-dependent model. This method is correspondence-free and works with low-resolution images of people. It is also view-invariant, albeit performance is optimal in near fronto-parallel configurations. Identification accuracy is estimated at 47{\%} for fronto-parallel sequences of 41 people, and 65{\%} for non-fronto-parallel sequences of 17 people, compared with 18{\%} and 51{\%}, respectively, when only stride and cadence are used.},

Among the wide range of shape descriptors, topological graph-like representations not only give a powerful and synthetic sketch of the object, but also capture its inner structure, that is how features connect together to give the overall shape. This aspect makes them useful to describe complex 3D objects in various applications like modeling, morphing, matching and recognition. The paper surveys the main properties of skeletons developed in shape modeling for representing objects.},

This approach is an example of an activity-specific biometric: a method of extracting identifying properties of an individual or of an individual' s behavior that is applicable only when a person is performing that specific action. To evaluate our parameters, we derive an expected confusion metric — related to mutual information — as opposed to reporting a percent correct with a limited database. This metric predicts how well a given feature vector will filter identity in a large population. We test the utility of a variety of body and stride parameters recovered in different viewing conditions on a database consisting of 15 to 20 subjects walking at both an angled and frontal-parallel view with respect to the camera, both indoors and out. We also analyze motion-capture data of the subjects to discover whether confusion in the parameters is inherently a physical or a visual measurement error property.},

  Abstract                 = {New scanning technologies are increasing the importance of 3D mesh data and the need for algorithms that can reliably align it. Surface registration is important for building full 3D models from partial scans, creating statistical shape models, shape retrieval, and tracking. The problem is particularly challenging for non-rigid and articulated objects like human bodies. While the challenges of real-world data registration are not present in existing synthetic datasets, establishing ground-truth correspondences for real 3D scans is difficult. We address this with a novel mesh registration technique that combines 3D shape and appearance information to produce high-quality alignments. We define a new dataset called FAUST that contains 300 scans of 10 people in a wide range of poses together with an evaluation methodology. To achieve accurate registration, we paint the subjects with high-frequency textures and use an extensive validation process to ensure accurate ground truth. We find that current shape registration methods have trouble with this real-world data. The dataset and evaluation website are available for research purposes at http://faust.is.tue.mpg.de.},

Particularly interesting instances of our SfO problem include: shape-from-Laplacian, allowing to transfer style between shapes; shape-from-difference operator, used to synthesize shape analogies; and shape-from-eigenvectors, allowing to generate "intrinsic averages" of shape collections. Numerically, we approach the SfO problem by splitting it into two optimization sub-problems: metric-from-operator (reconstruction of the discrete metric from the intrinsic operator) and embedding-from-metric (finding a shape embedding that would realize a given metric, a setting of the multidimensional scaling problem). We study numerical properties of our problem, exemplify it on several applications, and discuss its imitations.},

Our construction is based on localized frequency analysis (a generalization of the windowed Fourier transform to manifolds) that is used to extract the local behavior of some dense intrinsic descriptor, roughly acting as an analogy to patches in images. The resulting local frequency representations are then passed through a bank of filters whose coefficient are determined by a learning procedure minimizing a task-specific cost. Our approach generalizes several previous methods such as HKS, WKS, spectral CNN, and GPS embeddings. Experimental results show that the proposed approach allows learning class-specific shape descriptors significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.},

Robust attribute classifiers under such conditions must be invariant to pose, but inferring the pose in itself is a challenging problem. We use a part-based approach based on poselets. Our parts implicitly decompose the aspect (the pose and viewpoint). We train attribute classifiers for each such aspect and we combine them together in a discriminative model. We propose a new dataset of 8000 people with annotated attributes. Our method performs very well on this dataset, significantly outperforming a baseline built on the spatial pyramid match kernel method. On gender recognition we outperform a commercial face recognition system.},

  Abstract                 = {Feature-based approaches have recently become very popular in computer vision and image analysis applications, and are becoming a promising direction in shape retrieval. SHREC'10 robust feature detection and description benchmark simulates the feature detection and description stages of feature-based shape retrieval algorithms. The benchmark tests the performance of shape feature detectors and descriptors under a wide variety of trans- formations. The benchmark allows evaluating how algorithms cope with certain classes of transformations and strength of the transformations that can be dealt with. The present paper is a report of the SHREC'10 robust feature detection and description benchmark results},

  Abstract                 = {One of the biggest challenges in non-rigid shape retrieval and comparison is the design of a shape descriptor that would maintain invariance under a wide class of transformations the shape can undergo. Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling. We get significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms on recently established non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.},

  Abstract                 = {This systematic review collated seventy-eight studies exploring waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and waist circumference (WC) or BMI as predictors of diabetes and CVD, published in English between 1950 and 2008. Twenty-two prospective analyses showed that WHtR and WC were significant predictors of these cardiometabolic outcomes more often than BMI, with similar OR, sometimes being significant predictors after adjustment for BMI. Observations from cross-sectional analyses, forty-four in adults, thirteen in children, supported these predictions. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed mean area under ROC (AUROC) values of 0{\textperiodcentered}704, 0{\textperiodcentered}693 and 0{\textperiodcentered}671 for WHtR, WC and BMI, respectively. Mean boundary values for WHtR, covering all cardiometabolic outcomes, from studies in fourteen different countries and including Caucasian, Asian and Central American subjects, were 0{\textperiodcentered}50 for men and 0{\textperiodcentered}50 for women. WHtR and WC are therefore similar predictors of diabetes and CVD, both being stronger than, and independent of, BMI. To make firmer statistical comparison, a meta-analysis is required. The AUROC analyses indicate that WHtR may be a more useful global clinical screening tool than WC, with a weighted mean boundary value of 0{\textperiodcentered}5, supporting the simple public health message 'keep your waist circumference to less than half your height'.},

In this paper we consider possible generalizations of CNNs to signals defined on more general domains without the action of a translation group. In particular, we propose two constructions, one based upon a hierarchical clustering of the domain, and another based on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We show through experiments that for low-dimensional graphs it is possible to learn convolutional layers with a number of parameters independent of the input size, resulting in efficient deep architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {Virtually all social science research related to obesity studies a person's body mass index (BMI). Yet there is wide agreement in the medical literature that BMI is seriously flawed because it does not distinguish fat from fat-free mass such as muscle and bone. This paper studies data that include multiple measures of fatness and finds that many important patterns, such as who is classified as obese, group rates of obesity, and correlations of obesity with social science outcomes, are all sensitive to the measure of fatness and obesity used. We show that, relative to percent body fat, BMI misclassifies substantial fractions of individuals as obese or non-obese; in general, BMI is less accurate classifying men than women. Furthermore, when percent body fat instead of BMI is used to define obesity, the gap in obesity between white and African American men increases substantially but the gap in obesity between African American and white women is cut in half. Finally, total body fat is negatively correlated with employment for some groups and fat-free mass is not significantly correlated with employment for any group, a difference that was obscured in previous research that studied BMI. In the long run, social science datasets should include more accurate measures of fatness. In the short run, estimating more accurate measures of fatness using height and weight is not possible except by making unattractive assumptions, but there is also no reason to adhere uncritically to BMI as a measure of fatness. Social science research on obesity would be enriched by greater consideration of alternate specifications of weight and height and more accurate measures of fatness.},

Because the shape of such a character is determined by physical dynamics, the rigging system cannot simply dictate the shape as in traditional animation. For this reason, we introduce forces as the building blocks of rigging. Rigging forces guide the shape of the character, but are combined with other forces during simulation. Forces have other desirable features: they can be combined easily and simulated at any resolution, and since they are not tightly coupled with the surface geometry, they can be more easily transferred from one model to another. Our framework includes a new pose-dependent linearization scheme for elastic dynamics, which ensures a correspondence between forces and deformations, and at the same time produces plausible results at interactive speeds. We also introduce a novel method of handling collisions around creases.},

To incorporate skeletal controls, we introduce line constraints along the bones of simple skeletons. The bones are made to coincide with edges of the control lattice, which enables us to apply the constraints efficiently using algebraic methods. To accelerate computation, we associate regions of the volumetric mesh with particular bones and perform locally linearized simulations, which are blended at each time step. We define a hierarchical basis on the control lattice, so for detailed interactions the simulation can adapt the level of detail. We demonstrate the ability to animate complex models using simple skeletons and coarse volumetric meshes in a manner that simulates secondary motions at interactive rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Meshes are dominantly used to represent 3D models as they fit well with graphics rendering hardware. Features such as volume, moments, and Fourier transform coefficients need to be calculated from the mesh representation efficiently. We propose an algorithm to calculate these features without transforming the mesh into other representations such as the volumetric representation. To calculate a feature for a mesh, we show that we can first compute it for each elementary shape such as a triangle or a tetrahedron, and then add up all the values for the mesh. The algorithm is simple and efficient, with many potential applications},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology is proposed for creating and animating com-puter generated characters which combines recent research ad-vances in robotics, physically based modeling and geometric modeling. The control points of geometric modeling deforma-tions are constrained by an underlying articulated robotics skele-ton. These deformations are tailored by the animator and act as a muscle layer to provide automatic squash and stretch behavior of the surface geometry. A hierarchy of composite deformations provides the animator with a multi-layered approach to defining both local and global transition of the character's shape. The muscle deformations determine the resulting geometric surface of the character. This approach provides independent representa-tion of articulation from surface geometry, supports higher level motion control based on various computational models, as well as a consistent, uniform character representation which can be tuned and tweaked by the animator to meet very precise expres-sive qualities. A prototype system (Critter) currently under de-velopment demonstrates research results towards layered con-struction of deformable animated characters.},

The model is scale and translation invariant. In the training phase, image regions that optimize an objective function are automatically located in the training images, without requiring any user annotation such as bounding boxes. The objective function measures visual similarity between training image pairs, using the spatial distribution of both appearance patches and edges. The optimization is initialized using discriminative features. The model enables the detection (localization) of multiple instances of the object class in test images, and can be used as a precursor to training other visual models that require bounding box annotation. The detection performance of the model is assessed on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes Challenge 2006 test set. For a number of object classes the performance far exceeds the current state of the art of fully supervised methods.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Over the last few years computer based signal processing has become more prominent in forensic image analysis. Using the processing power of computers and the advances in mathematical algorithms it is now possible to generate a wealth of information from an image once it has been digitized. It has already been recognised that the image quality from many CCTV systems is generally too poor for facial recognition. However, there are other human characteristics which allow us to recognise individuals from a distance long before other aspects of their person become distinguishable. One of these parameters is a human's height. In this paper a new measurement algorithm is presented which generates height measurements and their associated errors from a single known physical measurement in an image. The method draws on results from projective geometry and computer vision. A "stereo like" correspondence between images is not required. The accuracy of the algorithm is demonstrated by a number of examples where ground truth is known. Finally, the height measurements and their variation are described for a person in motion. We draw attention to the uncertainty in heights associated with humans in motion and the limitations of using this description for identification.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

After reviewing existing edge and gradient based descriptors, we show experimentally that grids of histograms of oriented gradient (HOG) descriptors significantly outperform existing feature sets for human detection. We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of whole body surface area (WBSA) have important applications in numerous fields including biological anthropology, clinical medicine, biomechanics, and sports science. Currently, WBSA is most often estimated using predictive equations due to the complex and time consuming methods required for direct measurement. The main aim of this study was to identify whether there were significant and meaningful differences between WBSA measurements taken using a whole body three-dimensional (3D) scanner (criterion measure) and the estimates derived from each WBSA equation identified from a systematic review. The study also aimed to determine whether differences varied according to body mass index (BMI), sex, or athletic status. Fifteen WBSA equations were compared with direct measurements taken on 1,714 young adult subjects, aged 18-30 years, using the Vitus Smart 3D whole body scanner, including 1,452 subjects (753 males, 699 females) from the general Australian population and 262 rowers (148 males, 114 females). Mixed-design analysis of variances determined significant differences and accuracy was quantified using Bland-Altman analysis and effect sizes. Thirteen of the 15 equations overestimated WBSA. With a few exceptions, equations were accurate with a low-systematic error (bias ≤2\%) and low-random error (standard deviation of the differences 1.5-3.0\%). However, BMI did have a substantial impact with the accuracy of some WBSA equations varying between the four BMI categories. The Shuter and Aslani: Eur J Appl Physiol 82 (2000) 250-254 equation was identified as the most accurate equation and should be used for Western populations 18-30 years of age. Care must be taken when deciding which equation to use when estimating WBSA.},

We then address relations between traits and discuss associated benefits and limitations of these traits. We also consider two novel soft biometric traits, namely weight and color of clothes and we analyze their reliability. Related promising results on the performance are provided. Finally, we consider a new application, namely human identification solely carried out by a bag of facial, body and accessory soft biometric traits, and as an evidence of its practicality, we provide preliminary promising results. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The relationship between densitometrically-determined body fat percentage (BF{\%}) and BMI, taking age and sex (males = 1, females = 0) into account, was analysed. For children aged 15 years and younger, the relationship differed from that in adults, due to the height-related increase in BMI in children. In children the BF{\%} could be predicted by the formula BF{\%} = 1.51 x BMI-0.70 x age - 3.6 x sex + 1.4 (R2 0.38, SE of estimate (SEE) 4.4{\%} BF{\%}). In adults the prediction formula was: BF{\%} = 1.20 x BMI + 0.23 x age - 10.8 x sex - 5.4 (R2 0.79, SEE = 4.1{\%} BF{\%}). Internal and external cross-validation of the prediction formulas showed that they gave valid estimates of body fat in males and females at all ages. In obese subjects however, the prediction formulas slightly overestimated the BF{\%}. The prediction error is comparable to the prediction error obtained with other methods of estimating BF{\%}, such as skinfold thickness measurements or bioelectrical impedance.},

  Abstract                 = { Isometric surfaces share the same geometric structure, also known as the "first fundamental form." For example, all possible bendings of a given surface that includes all length preserving deformations without tearing or stretching the surface are considered to be isometric. We present a method to construct a bending invariant signature for such surfaces. This invariant representation is an embedding of the geometric structure of the surface in a small dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are approximated by Euclidean ones. The bending invariant representation is constructed by first measuring the intergeodesic distances between uniformly distributed points on the surface. Next, a multidimensional scaling technique is applied to extract coordinates in a finite dimensional Euclidean space in which geodesic distances are replaced by Euclidean ones. Applying this transform to various surfaces with similar geodesic structures (first fundamental form) maps them into similar signature surfaces. We thereby translate the problem of matching nonrigid objects in various postures into a simpler problem of matching rigid objects. As an example, we show a simple surface classification method that uses our bending invariant signatures.},

We demonstrate a variety of humancomputer interaction and capture scenarios. Experiments show an accuracy that outperforms a conventional light fall-off baseline, and is comparable to high-quality consumer depth cameras, but with a dramatically reduced cost, power consumption, and form-factor.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a discriminatively trained, multiscale, deformable part model for object detection. Our system achieves a two-fold improvement in average precision over the best performance in the 2006 PASCAL person detection challenge. It also outperforms the best results in the 2007 challenge in ten out of twenty categories. The system relies heavily on deformable parts. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL challenge. Our system also relies heavily on new methods for discriminative training. We combine a margin-sensitive approach for data mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM, like a hidden CRF, leads to a non-convex training problem. However, a latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. We believe that our training methods will eventually make possible the effective use of more latent information such as hierarchical (grammar) models and models involving latent three dimensional pose.

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts. A probabilistic representation is used for all aspects of the object: shape, appearance, occlusion and relative scale. An entropy-based feature detector is used to select regions and their scale within the image. In learning the parameters of the scale-invariant object model are estimated. This is done using expectation-maximization in a maximum-likelihood setting. In recognition, this model is used in a Bayesian manner to classify images. The flexible nature of the model is demonstrated by excellent results over a range of datasets including geometrically constrained classes (e.g. faces, cars) and flexible objects (such as animals).},

  Abstract                 = {In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities. However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images. Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive artistic imagery.},

The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout."--Publisher description.

  Abstract                 = {To test the hypothesis that overweight and central fat distribution make people look older and have poorer health.We asked 201 male and 161 female observers aged 28-67 y with body mass index (BMI) 17-45 kg/m2, to estimate the age of eight silhouette photographs of female volunteers with known BMI and waist and hips. Silhouette photographs were presented individually and grouped in three trios for analysis: trio A, each subject had waist to hip ratio = 0.7, BMI for each subject was 22, 24, 29 kg/m2; trio B, each subject had BMI = 22 kg/m2, waist to hip ratio for each subject was 0.66, 0.73, 0.99; and trio C, each subject had BMI = 29 kg/m2, waist to hip ratio for each subject was 0.76, 0.88, 0.99. The observers were then asked to judge the likelihood of developing heart disease, health and longevity of the silhouettes which were presented in four pairs controlling either for BMI or waist to hip ratio.The age of a silhouette with BMI 22 kg/m2 was estimated to be 35 y, 24 kg/m2 to be 45 y, and 30 kg/m2 to be 55 y, when waist to hip ratio was matched at 0.7. When BMI was controlled at either 22 or 29 kg/m2, higher waist to hip ratio led to a greater age estimation. An increase from a 65 cm to 88 cm waist circumference led to an estimate of 25 y older. Narrow hips was also judged as older. The silhouettes judged the more likely to be healthy and live longer were those with the lower waist to hip ratio (by 70\% observers), and the lower BMI (by 90\% observers). Waist to hip ratio appeared less influential when BMI of the silhouettes was high. The observers' own BMI, age or sex had little influences on their assessments of the age and health status of the silhouette photographs.Using novel sets of silhouette photographs, it was shown that overweight or central fat distribution and narrow hips suggest a person is older and has poorer health: People with BMI 29.7 kg/m2 appear to be 15-18 y older than those with BMI 22.2 kg/m2, each extra cm on the waist makes women appear to look a year older, and progressively less healthy. BMI and age of the observers had little influences on the findings.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a method to estimate the detailed 3D body shape of a person even if heavy or loose clothing is worn. The approach is based on a space of human shapes, learned from a large database of registered body scans. Together with this database we use as input a 3D scan or model of the person wearing clothes and apply a fitting method, based on ICP (iterated closest point) registration and Laplacian mesh deformation. The statistical model of human body shapes enforces that the model stays within the space of human shapes. The method therefore allows us to compute the most likely shape and pose of the subject, even if it is heavily occluded or body parts are not visible. Several experiments demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of our approach to recover occluded or missing body parts from 3D laser scans.},

The most widely used formula, that of Du Bois and Du Bois, increasingly underestimated {\{}SA{\}} as values fell below 0.7 m2; the disparity was greatest in the newborn infant (7.96 {\%}). Closer agreement was obtained with the equations and nomograms of Body, Brody, Faber and Melcher, and Sendroy and Cecchini, although minor deviations were noted in some age ranges. The formula {\{}SA{\}} (m2) = weight (kg)0.5378 × height (cm)0.3964 × 0.024265, derived from the measured data by multiple regression analysis, gave a good fit for all values of {\{}SA{\}} from less than 0.2 m2 to greater than 2.0 m2 (r = 0.998).

  Abstract                 = {—The use of a multi-camera system enables a robot to obtain a surround view, and thus, maximize its perceptual awareness of its environment. An accurate calibration is a nec-essary prerequisite if vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) is expected to provide reliable pose estimates for a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) with a multi-camera system. On our MAV, we set up each camera pair in a stereo configuration. We propose a novel vSLAM-based self-calibration method for a multi-sensor system that includes multiple calibrated stereo cameras and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our self-calibration estimates the transform with metric scale between each camera and the IMU. Once the MAV is calibrated, the MAV is able to estimate its global pose via a multi-camera vSLAM implementation based on the generalized camera model. We propose a novel minimal and linear 3-point algorithm that uses inertial information to recover the relative motion of the MAV with metric scale. Our constant-time vSLAM implementation with loop closures runs on-board the MAV in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, no published work has demonstrated real-time on-board vSLAM with loop closures. We show experimental results in both indoor and outdoor environments. The code for both the self-calibration and vSLAM is available as a set of ROS packages at https://github.com/hengli/vmav-ros-pkg.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach to camera calibration as a part of a complete and practical system to recover digital copies of sculpture from uncalibrated image sequences taken under turntable motion. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the silhouette coherence of a set of silhouettes generated by a 3D object. We show how the maximization of the silhouette coherence can be exploited to recover the camera poses and focal length. Silhouette coherence can be considered as a generalization of the well-known epipolar tangency constraint for calculating motion from silhouettes or outlines alone. Further, silhouette coherence exploits all the geometric information encoded in the silhouette (not just at epipolar tangency points) and can be used in many practical situations where point correspondences or outer epipolar tangents are unavailable. We present an algorithm for exploiting silhouette coherence to efficiently and reliably estimate camera motion. We use this algorithm to reconstruct very high quality 3D models from uncalibrated circular motion sequences, even when epipolar tangency points are not available or the silhouettes are truncated. The algorithm has been integrated into a practical system and has been tested on more than 50 uncalibrated sequences to produce high quality photo-realistic models. Three illustrative examples are included in this paper. The algorithm is also evaluated quantitatively by comparing it to a state-of-the-art system that exploits only epipolar tangents.},

In this paper, an application of the support vector (SV) regression technique to the inversion of electromagnetic data is presented. We take advantage of the regularizing properties of the SV learning algorithm and use it as a modeling technique with synthetic and field data. The SV method presents better recovery of synthetic models than Tikhonov's regularization. As the SV formulation is solved in the space of the data, which has a small dimension in this application, a smaller problem than that considered with Tikhonov's regularization is produced. For field data, the SV formulation develops models similar to those obtained via linear programming techniques, but with the added characteristic of robustness.},

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The normal body mass index (BMI) range, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), is quite wide, and some people within this range may have excessive central fat accumulation and elevated metabolic risks. We hypothesize that the waist-to-height ratio (W/Ht), an effective index for assessing central fat distribution among Japanese people, can be used to identify subjects who are at higher metabolic risk within the normal as well as the overweight range. METHODS: We investigated: (1). the values of BMI, waist circumference, and W/Ht in 6141 men and 2137 women at various age intervals and calculated gender (female to male) ratios for all these anthropometric indices; (2). the relation between age and each anthropometric index, between age and morbidity index for coronary risk factors (sum of the scores for hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, and low HDL cholesterol; one point for each condition if present), and between morbidity index for coronary risk factors and each anthropometric index; (3). the distributions of the subjects, using various proposed indices of waist circumference (those suggested by WHO, the Japan Society for the Study of Obesity, and the Asia-Pacific perspective), and our proposed boundary value, W/Ht 0.5, among the WHO categories based on BMI; (4). the metabolic risks (coronary risk factors, hyperuricemia, high gamma-glutamyltransferase, and fatty liver diagnosed by ultrasonography), and exercise habits among normal-weight subjects with W/Ht{\textless}0.5 or {\textgreater}or=0.5. RESULTS: (1). For the various anthropometric indices in all age groups, the gender ratio for W/Ht was closest to 1, indicating that a single set of values for W/Ht can be used for men and women. (2). Height correlated negatively with age. Among the anthropometric indices, only W/Ht correlated positively with age for both men and women, while age and all anthropometric indices, except height, correlated positively with the morbidity index for coronary risk factors. For both men and women, the highest correlation coefficient was between W/Ht and the morbidity index for coronary risk factors. (3). Nearly all overweight men and women (BMI{\textgreater}or=25) had W/Ht{\textgreater}or=0.5 (98.5{\%} of men and 97.5{\%} of women). None of the underweight subjects had W/Ht{\textgreater}or=0.5. However, 45.5{\%} of men and 28.3{\%} of women of normal weight (BMI 18.5-{\textless}25) had W/Ht{\textgreater}or=0.5. W/Ht, of all the indices investigated, was the best index for signaling metabolic risk in the normal-weight subjects as well as the overweight subjects. (4). Age- and BMI-adjusted odds ratios for multiple metabolic risks, and history of no habitual exercise were significantly higher in normal-weight men and women with W/Ht{\textgreater}or=0.5 than in others of normal weight. CONCLUSIONS: Waist circumference is improved by relating it to height to categorized fat distribution of different genders and ages. W/Ht is a simple and practical anthropometric index to identify higher metabolic risks in normal and overweight Japanese men and women.},

Soft biometrics is a research topic that has attracted a lot of attention recently. The application of soft biometrics in security technology is very promising because it has strong privacy measures and it improves service quality because service is provided that is appropriate to each subject of the soft biometrics application, i.e., the person picked up on camera. Soft biometrics is defined as characteristics that provide some information about an individual but that lack high distinctiveness and performance to sufficiently differentiate any two individuals. We introduce here a summary of soft biometrics and its applications. We also introduce our work in this field. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The object is represented by a set of viewpoint invariant region descriptors so that recognition can proceed successfully despite changes in viewpoint, illumination and partial occlusion. The temporal continuity of the video within a shot is used to track the regions in order to reject unstable regions and reduce the effects of noise in the descriptors. The analogy with text retrieval is in the implementation where matches on descriptors are pre-computed (using vector quantization), and inverted file systems and document rankings are used. The result is that retrieved is immediate, returning a ranked list of key frames/shots in the manner of Google. The method is illustrated for matching in two full length feature films.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional validation study of sedentary individuals. SUBJECTS: The Heritage Family Study cohort of 665 black and white men and women who ranged in age from 17 to 65 y. MEASUREMENTS: Body density determined from hydrostatic weighing. Percentage body fat determined with gender and race-specific, two-compartment models. BMI determined from height and weight, and sex and race in dummy coded form. RESULTS: Polynomial regression showed that the relationship between {\%}fat and BMI was quadratic for both men and women. A natural log transformation of BMI adjusted for the non-linearity. Test for homogeneity of log transformed BMI and gender showed that the male-female slopes were within random variance, but the intercepts differed. For the same BMI, the {\%}fat of females was 10.4{\%} higher than that of males. General linear models analysis of the women's data showed that age, race and race-by-BMI interaction were independently related to {\%}fat. The same analysis applied to the men's data showed that {\%}fat was not just a function of BMI, but also age and age-by-BMI interaction. Multiple regression analyses provided models that defined the bias. CONCLUSIONS: These data and results published in the literature show that BMI and {\%}fat relationship are not independent of age and gender. These data showed a race effect for women, but not men. The failure to adjust for these sources of bias resulted in substantial differences in the proportion of subjects defined as obese by measured {\%}fat.},

In this paper, we propose ShapeNet, a generalization of the popular convolutional neural networks (CNN) paradigm to non-Euclidean manifolds. Our construction is based on a local geodesic system of polar coordinates to extract "patches", which are then passed through a cascade of filters and linear and non-linear operators. The coefficients of the filters and linear combination weights are optimization variables that are learned to minimize a task-specific cost function. We use ShapeNet to learn invariant shape feature descriptors that significantly outperform recent state-of-the-art methods, and show that previous approaches such as heat and wave kernel signatures, optimal spectral descriptors, and intrinsic shape contexts can be obtained as particular configurations of ShapeNet.},

Data on body mass, the body mass index [BMI; mass (kg)/stature (m)2], the surface area/body mass ratio, and relative sitting height (RSH; sitting height/stature) were obtained for 223 male samples and 195 female samples derived from studies published since D.F. Roberts' landmark paper ``Body weight, race, and climate'' in 1953 (Am. J. Phys. Anthropol. 11:533-558). Current analyses indicate that body mass varies inversely with mean annual temperature in males (r=-0.27, P < 0.001) and females (r=-0.28, P < 0.001), as does the BMI (males: r=-0.22, P=0.001; females: r=-0.30, P < 0.001). The surface area/body mass ratio is positively correlated with temperature in both sexes (males: r=0.29, P < 0.001; females: r=0.34, P < 0.001), whereas the relationship between RSH and temperature is negative (males: r=-0.37, P < 0.001; females: r=-0.46, P < 0.001). These results are consistent with previous work showing that humans follow the ecological rules of Bergmann and Allen. However, the slope of the best-fit regressions between measures of body mass (i.e., mass, BMI, and surface area/mass) and temperature are more modest than those presented by Roberts. These differences appear to be attributable to secular trends in mass, particularly among tropical populations. Body mass and the BMI have increased over the last 40 years, whereas the surface area/body mass ratio has decreased. These findings indicate that, although climatic factors continue to be significant correlates of world-wide variation in human body size and morphology, differential changes in nutrition among tropical, developing world populations have moderated their influence.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim: The study examined the association between perceived body size (through self-selection of Stunkard's body shape silhouettes) and measured body mass index (BMI) in Mexican Mestiso adult men and women, and determined the BMI values that corresponded to each silhouette. Subjects: A sample of 1092 men and 1247 women, apparently healthy, aged 20-69, was studied. Methods: Participants were asked to identify the silhouette that most accurately represented his/her body size. Weight and height were measured in duplicate to calculate BMI. A simple linear regression analysis was used to adjust BMI values to silhouette categories by gender. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated to assess accuracy. Results: Gender-specific BMI values for each silhouette were obtained. Correlation coefficients between silhouette ratings and BMI were 0.702 in males and 0.766 in females. Overweight ranged from silhouette 4 to 6 and obesity from silhouette 6 to 9, in both men and women. In the regression models, 49.3{\%} of BMI variance in males and 58.7{\%} in females were explained statistically by silhouette self-selection. AUC were higher than 0.8 for overweight and obesity in males and females. Conclusions: Both male and female models had a good fit, indicating that BMI can be associated with body shape silhouettes. Silhouettes can be useful for defining overweight and obesity in settings such as schools or worksites, or where scales and stadiometers might not be available. They can also be used to provide health advice to the public. © 2006 Informa UK Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the challenges in 3D shape matching arises from the fact that in many applications, models should be considered to be the same if they differ by a rotation. Consequently, when comparing two models, a similarity metric implicitly provides the measure of similarity at the optimal alignment. Explicitly solving for the optimal alignment is usually impractical. So, two general methods have been proposed for addressing this issue: (1) Every model is represented using rotation invariant descriptors. (2) Every model is described by a rotation dependent descriptor that is aligned into a canonical coordinate system defined by the model. In this paper, we describe the limitations of canonical alignment and discuss an alternate method, based on spherical harmonics, for obtaining rotation invariant representations. We describe the properties of this tool and show how it can be applied to a number of existing, orientation dependent descriptors to improve their matching performance. The advantages of this tool are two-fold: First, it improves the matching performance of many descriptors.

Analyses are also reported on the relationship of those indicators of relative weight to body density in 180 young men and in 248 men aged 49–59. Judged by the criteria of correlation with height (lowest is best) and to measures of body fatness (highest is best), the ponderal index is the poorest of the relative weight indices studied. The ratio of weight to height squared, here termed the body mass index, is slightly better in these respects than the simple ratio of weight to height. The body mass index seems preferable over other indices of relative weight on these grounds as well as on the simplicity of the calculation and, in contrast to percentage of average weight, the applicability to all populations at all times.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To determine which simple index of overweight and obesity is the best discriminator of cardiovascular risk factors. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a meta-analysis of published literature. MEDLINE was searched. Studies that used receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis and published area under the ROC curves (AUC) for overweight and obesity indices with hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and/or dyslipidemia were included. The AUC for each of the four indices, with each risk factor, was pooled using a random-effects model; male and female data were analyzed separately. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Body mass index (BMI) was the poorest discriminator for cardiovascular risk factors. Waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was the best discriminator for hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in both sexes; its pooled AUC (95{\%} confidence intervals) ranged from 0.67 (0.64, 0.69) to 0.73 (0.70, 0.75) and from 0.68 (0.63, 0.72) to 0.76 (0.70, 0.81) in males and females, respectively. CONCLUSION: Statistical evidence supports the superiority of measures of centralized obesity, especially WHtR, over BMI, for detecting cardiovascular risk factors in both men and women.},

  Abstract                 = {Many studies have uncovered evidence that visual cortex contains specialized re- gions involved in processing faces but not other object classes. Recent electro- physiology studies of cells in several of these specialized regions revealed that at least some of these regions are organized in a hierarchicalmanner with viewpoint- specific cells projecting to downstream viewpoint-invariant identity-specific cells [1]. A separate computational line of reasoning leads to the claimthat some trans- formations of visual inputs that preserve viewed object identity are class-specific. In particular, the 2D images evoked by a face undergoing a 3D rotation are not produced by the same image transformation (2D) that would produce the images evoked by an object of another class undergoing the same 3D rotation. How- ever, within the class of faces, knowledge of the image transformation evoked by 3D rotation can be reliably transferred from previously viewed faces to help identify a novel face at a new viewpoint. We show, through computational sim- ulations, that an architecture which applies this method of gaining invariance to class-specific transformations is effective when restricted to faces and fails spec- tacularly when applied to other object classes. We argue here that in order to accomplish viewpoint-invariant face identification from a single example view, visual cortex must separate the circuitry involved in discounting 3D rotations of faces fromthe generic circuitry involved in processing other objects. The resulting model of the ventral stream of visual cortex is consistent with the recent physiol- ogy results showing the hierarchical organization of the face processing network.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale 3D shape retrieval has become an important research direction in content-based 3D shape retrieval. To promote this research area, two Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) tracks on large scale comprehensive and sketch-based 3D model retrieval have been organized by us in 2014. Both tracks were based on a unified large-scale benchmark that supports multimodal queries (3D models and sketches). This benchmark contains 13680 sketches and 8987 3D models, divided into 171 distinct classes. It was compiled to be a superset of existing benchmarks and presents a new challenge to retrieval methods as it comprises generic models as well as domain-specific model types. Twelve and six distinct 3D shape retrieval methods have competed with each other in these two contests, respectively. To measure and compare the performance of the participating and other promising Query-by-Model or Query-by-Sketch 3D shape retrieval methods and to solicit state-of-the-art approaches, we perform a more comprehensive comparison of twenty-six (eighteen originally participating algorithms and eight additional state-of-the-art or new) retrieval methods by evaluating them on the common benchmark. The benchmark, results, and evaluation tools are publicly available at our websites (http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/vug/sharp/contest/2014/Generic3D/, 2014, http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/vug/sharp/contest/2014/SBR/, 2014).},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a 3D approach to multi-view object class detection. Most existing approaches recognize object classes for a particular viewpoint or combine classifiers for a few discrete views. We propose instead to build 3D representations of object classes which allow to handle viewpoint changes and intra-class variability. Our approach extracts a set of pose and class discriminant features from synthetic 3D object models using a filtering procedure, evaluates their suitability for matching to real image data and represents them by their appearance and 3D position. We term these representations 3D Feature Maps. For recognizing an object class in an image we match the synthetic descriptors to the real ones in a 3D voting scheme. Geometric coherence is reinforced by means of a robust pose estimation which yields a 3D bounding box in addition to the 2D localization. The precision of the 3D pose estimation is evaluated on a set of images of a calibrated scene. The 2D localization is evaluated on the PASCAL 2006 dataset for motorbikes and cars, showing that its performance can compete with state-of-the-art 2D object detectors.},

Autopsy studies have shown that certain hippocampal subfields are more vulnerable than others to AD and FTLD pathology, in particular the subiculum and cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). We conducted shape analysis of hippocampi segmented from structural T1 MRI images on clinically diagnosed dementia patients and controls. The subjects included 19 AD and 35 FTLD patients [13 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), 13 semantic dementia (SD), and 9 progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)] and 21 controls. Compared to controls, SD displayed severe atrophy of the whole left hippocampus. PNFA and FTD also displayed atrophy on the left side, restricted to the hippocampal head in FTD. Finally, AD displayed most atrophy in left hippocampal body with relative sparing of the hippocampal head. Consistent with neuropathological studies, most atrophic deformation was found in CA1 and subiculum areas in FTLD and AD.},

  Abstract                 = {Informative and discriminative feature descriptors play a fundamental role in deformable shape analysis. For example, they have been successfully employed in correspondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In recent years, significant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the spectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the shape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and the recently introduced wave kernel signature (WKS). The Laplacian-based descriptors achieve state-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are computationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can gracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate a generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that to be optimized for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the statistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the "signal") and those of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the "noise"). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be learned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal processing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimized spectral descriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of the proposed approach in generating correspondences is demonstrated on synthetic and scanned human figures. We also show that the learned descriptors are robust enough to be learned on synthetic data and transferred successfully to scanned shapes.},

With the recent advance of feature-based methods in geometric shape analysis, there is significant interest in finding analogous approaches in the 3D world. In this paper, we formulate a diffusion-geometric framework for stable component detection in non-rigid 3D shapes, which can be used for geometric feature detection and description. A quantitative evaluation of our method on the SHREC'10 feature detection benchmark shows its potential as a source of high-quality features. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Recently, view-based methods have attracted much research attention due to the high discriminative property of multi-views for 3D object representation. In this report, we summarize the view-based 3D model methods and provide the further research trends. This paper focuses on the scheme for matching between multiple views of 3D models and the application of bag-of-visual-words method in 3D model retrieval. For matching between multiple views, the many-to-many matching, probabilistic matching and semisupervised learning methods are introduced. For bag-of-visual-words application in 3D model retrieval, we first briefly review the bag-of-visual-words works on multimedia and computer vision tasks, where the visual dictionary has been detailed introduced. Then a series of 3D model retrieval methods by using bag-of-visual-words description are surveyed in this paper. At last, we summarize the further research content in view-based 3D model retrieval.},

To ensure that PB-MHB are orthogonal to each other, it is necessary to have symmetrizable discrete Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) over the surfaces. Existing converging discrete LBO for point clouds, as proposed by Belkin et al. [CHECK END OF SENTENCE], is not guaranteed to be symmetrizable. We build a new point-wisely discrete LBO over the point-sampled surface that is guaranteed to be symmetrizable, and prove its convergence. By solving the eigen problem related to the new operator, we define a set of orthogonal bases over the point cloud. Experiments show that the new operator is converging better than other symmetrizable discrete Laplacian operators (such as graph Laplacian) defined on point-sampled surfaces, and can provide orthogonal bases for further spectral geometric analysis and processing tasks.},

While taking measurements from 3D scanning data, markers are usually placed on human body to facilitate landmarking and data collection. But the procedure of placing markers is very tedious and may involve human errors. The objective of this study is to develop an automated anthropometric data collection system to eliminate manual intervention. For 3D image analysis, the first step is to segment the body parts by analyzing the 2D silhouette. Then we use the approximate location estimates as the references for performing initial searches of the landmarks. Subsequently, four algorithms including silhouette analysis, minimum circumference determination, gray-scale detection, and human-body contour plots are developed to extract 12 landmarks and three characteristic lines on human body. Finally, from the results of automated landmarking, 104 anthropometric data can be obtained. To evaluate the validity and reliability of the automated anthropometric data collection system, 189 human subjects were scanned and the scanning data were processed by the system. The results demonstrated that the system was very effective and robust. Based on the newly developed system, many applications can be extended.},

  Abstract                 = {This posthumously published book (1982), which influenced a generation of brain and cognitive scientists, inspiring many to enter the field, describes a general framework for understanding visual perception and touches on broader questions about how the brain and its functions can be studied and understood. This MIT Press edition makes this work available to a new generation of students and scientists. In the author's framework, the process of vision constructs a set of representations, starting from a description of the input image and culminating with a description of three-dimensional objects in the surrounding environment. A central theme, and one that has had far-reaching influence in both neuroscience and cognitive science, is the notion of different levels of analysis—in the author's framework, the computational level, the algorithmic level, and the hardware implementation level. Now, thirty years later, the main problems that occupied the author remain fundamental open problems in the study of perception. His book provides inspiration for the continuing efforts to integrate knowledge from cognition and computation to understand vision and the brain.},

  Abstract                 = {A theory of edge detection is presented. The analysis proceeds in two parts. (1) Intensity changes, which occur in a natural image over a wide range of scales, are detected separately at different scales. An appropriate filter for this purpose at a given scale is found to be the second derivative of a Gaussian, and it is shown that, provided some simple conditions are satisfied, these primary filters need not be orientation-dependent. Thus, intensity changes at a given scale are best detected by finding the zero values of [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}G(x, y)* I(x, y) for image I, where G(x, y) is a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution and [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} is the Laplacian. The intensity changes thus discovered in each of the channels are then represented by oriented primitives called zero-crossing segments, and evidence is given that this representation is complete. (2) Intensity changes in images arise from surface discontinuities or from reflectance or illumination boundaries, and these all have the property that they are spatially localized. Because of this, the zero-crossing segments from the different channels are not independent, and rules are deduced for combining them into a description of the image. This description is called the raw primal sketch. The theory explains several basic psychophysical findings, and the operation of forming oriented zero-crossing segments from the output of centre-surround [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}G filters acting on the image forms the basis for a physiological model of simple cells (see Marr {\&} Ullman 1979).},

  Abstract                 = {The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing correspon-dences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints is studied. A new set of image elements that are put into correspondence, the so called extremal regions, is introduced. Extremal regions possess highly de-sirable properties: the set is closed under 1. continuous (and thus projective) transformation of image coordinates and 2. monotonic transformation of im-age intensities. An efficient (near linear complexity) and practically fast de-tection algorithm (near frame rate) is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal regions (MSER). A new robust similarity measure for establishing tentative correspon-dences is proposed. The robustness ensures that invariants from multiple measurement regions (regions obtained by invariant constructions from ex-tremal regions), some that are significantly larger (and hence discriminative) than the MSERs, may be used to establish tentative correspondences. The high utility of MSERs, multiple measurement regions and the robust metric is demonstrated in wide-baseline experiments on image pairs from both indoor and outdoor scenes. Significant change of scale (3.5×), illumi-nation conditions, out-of-plane rotation, occlusion , locally anisotropic scale change and 3D translation of the viewpoint are all present in the test prob-lems. Good estimates of epipolar geometry (average distance from corre-sponding points to the epipolar line below 0.09 of the inter-pixel distance) are obtained.},

In this paper, we present a new approach for measuring human height based on the cross ratio. This approach is performed in parallel with the vanishing point based approach for comparison. The accuracy of each approach is examined by comparing the estimated value to the actual static height value which is measured directly. For the height measurement from video, our analyses show that human height varies significantly during human motion and the highest point in a human stride is the most accurate measurement of the static height. We also model the height variation as a sinusoidal pattern to maximize the accuracy of the estimated height. For the height measurement from a single frame, a correction method is developed in which the length of the human torso with human head and the length of the human leg are separately estimated. We conclude that static human height can be measured accurately, even though the variation of human height is significant during human motion.},

  Abstract                 = {Measuring the similarity between 3D shapes is a fundamental problem, with applications in computer graphics, computer vision, molecular biology, and a variety of other fields. A challenging aspect of this problem is to find a suitable shape signature that can be constructed and compared quickly, while still discriminating between similar and dissimilar shapes.In this paper, we propose and analyze a method for computing shape signatures for arbitrary (possibly degenerate) 3D polygonal models. The key idea is to represent the signature of an object as a shape distribution sampled from a shape function measuring global geometric properties of an object. The primary motivation for this approach is to reduce the shape matching problem to the comparison of probability distributions, which is simpler than traditional shape matching methods that require pose registration, feature correspondence, or model fitting.We find that the dissimilarities between sampled distributions of simple shape functions (e.g., the distance between two random points on a surface) provide a robust method for discriminating between classes of objects (e.g., cars versus airplanes) in a moderately sized database, despite the presence of arbitrary translations, rotations, scales, mirrors, tessellations, simplifications, and model degeneracies. They can be evaluated quickly, and thus the proposed method could be applied as a pre-classifier in a complete shape-based retrieval or analysis system concerned with finding similar whole objects. The paper describes our early experiences using shape distributions for object classification and for interactive web-based retrieval of 3D models.},

  Abstract                 = {The description of the spatial characteristics of two- and three-dimensional objects, in the framework of MPEG-7, is considered. The shape of an object is one of its fundamental properties, and this paper describes an efficient way to represent the coarse shape, scale and composition properties of an object. This representation is invariant to resolution, translation and rotation, and may be used for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) objects. This coarse shape descriptor will be included in the eXperimentation Model (XM) of MPEG-7. Applications of such a description to search object databases, in particular the CAESAR anthropometric database are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Human-nameable visual “attributes” can benefit vari- ous recognition tasks. However, existing techniques restrict these properties to categorical labels (for example, a per- son is ‘smiling' or not, a scene is ‘dry' or not), and thus fail to capture more general semantic relationships. We propose to model relative attributes. Given training data stating how object/scene categories relate according to dif- ferent attributes, we learn a ranking function per attribute. The learned ranking functions predict the relative strength of each property in novel images. We then build a genera- tive model over the joint space of attribute ranking outputs, and propose a novel form of zero-shot learning in which the supervisor relates the unseen object category to previously seen objects via attributes (for example, ‘bears are furrier than giraffes'). We further show how the proposed relative attributes enable richer textual descriptions for newimages, which in practice are more precise for human interpreta- tion. We demonstrate the approach on datasets of faces and natural scenes, and show its clear advantages over tradi- tional},

  Abstract                 = {In the area of image retrieval from data bases and for copyright protection of large image collections there is a growing demand for unique but easily computable fingerprints for images. These fingerprints can be used to quickly identify every image within a larger set of possibly similar images. This paper introduces a novel method to automatically obtain such fingerprints from an image. It is based on a reinterpretation of an image as a Riemannian manifold. This representation is feasible for gray value images and color images. We discuss the use of the spectrum of eigenvalues of different variants of the Laplace operator as a fingerprint and show the usability of this approach in several use cases. Contrary to existing works in this area we do not only use the discrete Laplacian, but also with a particular emphasis the underlying continuous operator. This allows better results in comparing the resulting spectra and deeper insights in the problems arising. We show how the well known discrete Laplacian is related to the continuous Laplace-Beltrami operator. Furthermore, we introduce the new concept of solid height functions to overcome some potential limitations of the method. ?? 2007.},

  Abstract                 = {The Fisher kernel (FK) is a generic framework which com-bines the benefits of generative and discriminative approaches. In the context of image classification the FK was shown to extend the popular bag-of-visual-words (BOV) by going beyond count statistics. However, in practice, this enriched representation has not yet shown its superiority over the BOV. In the first part we show that with several well-motivated modifications over the original framework we can boost the accuracy of the FK. On PASCAL VOC 2007 we increase the Average Precision (AP) from 47.9{\%} to 58.3{\%}. Similarly, we demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on CalTech 256. A major advantage is that these results are obtained us-ing only SIFT descriptors and costless linear classifiers. Equipped with this representation, we can now explore image classification on a larger scale. In the second part, as an application, we compare two abundant re-sources of labeled images to learn classifiers: ImageNet and Flickr groups. In an evaluation involving hundreds of thousands of training images we show that classifiers learned on Flickr groups perform surprisingly well (although they were not intended for this purpose) and that they can complement classifiers learned on more carefully annotated datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {(from the cover) We readily recognize the faces of our friends and the objects around us. We do so effortlessly, but these cannot be simple tasks for our visual systems. Faces are all extremely similar as visual patterns. We see objects from different viewpoints and in different arrangements. How does the visual system solve these problems? The contributors to this volume attempt to answer this question by considering how analytic and holistic processes contribute to the perception of faces, objects, and scenes. The role of parts and wholes in perception has been studied for a century, beginning with the debate between structuralists who championed the role of elements and Gestalt psychologists who emphasized the role of wholes. In this volume, the contributors ask whether analytic and holistic processes contribute differently to the perception of faces and objects. They also consider whether different mechanisms code holistic and analytic information or whether a single universal system can suffice. The contributors to this collection offer some intriguing answers to these questions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2003 APA, all rights reserved).},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global public health challenge. In the US, for instance, obesity prevalence remains high at more than one-third of the adult population, while over two-thirds are obese or overweight. Obesity is associated with various health problems, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), depression, some forms of cancer, sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, among others. The body mass index (BMI) is one of the best known measures of obesity. The BMI, however, has serious limitations, for instance, its inability to capture the distribution of lean mass and adipose tissue, which is a better predictor of diabetes and CVDs, and its curved ("U-shaped") relationship with mortality hazard. Other anthropometric measures and their relation to obesity have been studied, each with its advantages and limitations. In this work, we introduce a new anthropometric measure (called Surface-based Body Shape Index, SBSI) that accounts for both body shape and body size, and evaluate its performance as a predictor of all-cause mortality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data on 11,808 subjects (ages 18-85), from the National Health and Human Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2004, with 8-year mortality follow up. Based on the analysis, we introduce a new body shape index constructed from four important anthropometric determinants of body shape and body size: body surface area (BSA), vertical trunk circumference (VTC), height (H) and waist circumference (WC). The surface-based body shape index (SBSI) is defined as follows: [Formula: see text] SBSI has negative correlation with BMI and weight respectively, no correlation with WC, and shows a generally linear relationship with age. Results on mortality hazard prediction using both the Cox proportionality model, and Kaplan-Meier curves each show that SBSI outperforms currently popular body shape indices (e.g., BMI, WC, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), A Body Shape Index (ABSI)) in predicting all-cause mortality.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We combine measures of both body shape and body size to construct a novel anthropometric measure, the surface-based body shape index (SBSI). SBSI is generally linear with age, and increases with increasing mortality, when compared with other popular anthropometric indices of body shape.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an approach for object recognition that combines detection and segmentation within a efficient hypothesize/test framework. Scanning-window template classifiers are the current state-of-the-art for many object classes such as faces, cars, and pedestrians. Such approaches, though quite successful, can be hindered by their lack of explicit encoding of object shape/structure - one might, for example, find faces in trees. We adopt the following strategy; we first use these systems as attention mechanisms, generating many possible object locations by tuning them for low missed-detections and high false-positives. At each hypothesized detection, we compute a local figure-ground segmentation using a window of slightly larger extent than that used by the classifier. This segmentation task is guided by top-down knowledge. We learn offline from training data those segmentations that are consistent with true positives. We then prune away those hypotheses with bad segmentations. We show this strategy leads to significant improvements (10-20{\%}) over established approaches such as ViolaJones and DalalTriggs on a variety of benchmark datasets including the PASCAL challenge, LabelMe, and the INRIAPerson dataset.},

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database. 1},

More recently, the use of soft biometric traits has been proposed to improve the performance of traditional biometric systems and allow identification based on human descriptions. Soft biometric traits include characteristics such as height, weight, body geometry, scars, marks, and tattoos (SMT), gender, etc. These traits offer several advantages over traditional biometric techniques. Soft biometric traits can be typically described using human understandable labels and measurements, allowing for retrieval and recognition solely based on verbal descriptions. Unlike many primary biometric traits, soft biometrics can be obtained at a distance without subject cooperation and from low quality video footage, making them ideal for use in surveillance applications.

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes the use of the surface-based Laplace-Beltrami and the volumetric Laplace eigenvalues and eigenfunctions as shape descriptors for the comparison and analysis of shapes. These spectral measures are isometry invariant and therefore allow for shape comparisons with minimal shape pre-processing. In particular, no registration, mapping, or remeshing is necessary. The discriminatory power of the 2D surface and 3D solid methods is demonstrated on a population of female caudate nuclei (a subcortical gray matter structure of the brain, involved in memory function, emotion processing, and learning) of normal control subjects and of subjects with schizotypal personality disorder. The behavior and properties of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are discussed extensively for both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary condition showing advantages of the Neumann vs. the Dirichlet spectra in 3D. Furthermore, topological analyses employing the Morse-Smale complex (on the surfaces) and the Reeb graph (in the solids) are performed on selected eigenfunctions, yielding shape descriptors, that are capable of localizing geometric properties and detecting shape differences by indirectly registering topological features such as critical points, level sets and integral lines of the gradient field across subjects. The use of these topological features of the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions in 2D and 3D for statistical shape analysis is novel. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In a scenario where this class is represented by a small set of example shapes, the proposed method learns a shape descriptor capturing the variability of the deformations in the given class. The approach enables the wave kernel signature to extend the class of recognized deformations from near isometries to the deformations appearing in the example set by means of a random forest classifier. With the help of the introduced spatial regularization, the proposed method achieves significant improvements over the baseline approach and obtains state-of-the-art results while keeping short computation times.},

Solid objects are modeled by combining primitive solids, such as blocks and cylinders, using the set operators union, intersection, and difference. To visualize and analyze the composite solids modeled, virtual light rays are cast as probes. By virtue of its simplicity, ray casting is reliable and extensible. The most difficult mathematical problem is finding line-surface intersection points. So surfaces such as planes, quadrics, tori, and probably even parametric surface patches may bound the primitive solids. The adequacy and efficiency of ray casting are issues addressed here. A fast picture generation capability for interactive modeling is the biggest challenge. New methods are presented, accompanied by sample pictures and CPU times, to meet the challenge.},

SUBJECTS: One hundred and seventy-five males, aged 7.0-16.9 y, participated in this study, they were recruited from primary and secondary schools. MEASUREMENTS: Body weight and height and skinfold thicknesses by anthropometry, body density by underwater weighing. RESULTS: Correlations between body density and body mass index (BMI) were high until 14.0-16.9y. Correlations between body density and log sigma 4 skinfolds were higher than those with BMI at all ages. Log sigma 4 skinfolds explained between 61{\%} (14.0-16.9 y) and 68{\%} (11.0-13.9 y) of the body density variance. Regression equations for body density from BMI and triceps skinfold thickness explained between 51{\%} (14.0-16.9y) and 68{\%} (7.0-10.9 y) of the body density variance. CONCLUSIONS: The best estimators of body density in the children and adolescents studied were log sigma 4 skinfolds and a combination of BMI and triceps skinfold.},

  Abstract                 = {An important task in object recognition is to enable algorithms to$\backslash$ncategorize objects under arbitrary poses in a cluttered 3D world.$\backslash$nA recent paper by Savarese {\&} Fei-Fei [1] has proposed a novel representation$\backslash$nto model 3D object classes. In this representation stable parts of$\backslash$nobjects from one class are linked together to capture both the appearance$\backslash$nand shape properties of the object class. We propose to extend this$\backslash$nframework and improve the ability of the model to recognize poses$\backslash$nthat have not been seen in training. Inspired by works in single$\backslash$nobject view synthesis (e.g., Seitz {\&} Dyer [2]), our new representation$\backslash$nallows the model to synthesize novel views of an object class at$\backslash$nrecognition time. This mechanism is incorporated in a novel two-step$\backslash$nalgorithm that is able to classify objects under arbitrary and/or$\backslash$nunseen poses. We compare our results on pose categorization with$\backslash$nthe model and dataset presented in [1]. In a second experiment, we$\backslash$ncollect a new, more challenging dataset of 8 object classes from$\backslash$ncrawling the web. In both experiments, our model shows competitive$\backslash$nperformances compared to [1] for classifying objects in unseen poses.},

We consider the influence of the musculature on surface form and develop muscle models which react automati- cally to changes in the posture of an underlying articulated skeleton. Themodels are implemented in a procedural language that provides convenient facilities for defining andmanipulating articulatedmod- els. To illustrate their operation, the models are applied to the torso and arm of a human figure. However, they are sufficiently general to be applied in other contexts where articulated skeletons provide the basis of modeling.},

  Abstract                 = {For identity related problems, descriptive attributes can take the form of any information that helps represent an individual, including age data, describable visual attributes, and contextual data. With a rich set of descriptive attributes, it is possible to enhance the base matching accuracy of a traditional face identification system through intelligent score weighting. If we can factor any attribute differences between people into our match score calculation, we can deemphasize incorrect results, and ideally lift the correct matching record to a higher rank position. Naturally, the presence of all descriptive attributes during a match instance cannot be expected, especially when considering non-biometric context. Thus, in this paper, we examine the application of Bayesian Attribute Networks to combine descriptive attributes and produce accurate weighting factors to apply to match scores from face recognition systems based on incomplete observations made at match time. We also examine the pragmatic concerns of attribute network creation, and introduce a Noisy-OR formulation for streamlined truth value assignment and more accurate weighting. Experimental results show that incorporating descriptive attributes into the matching process significantly enhances face identification over the baseline by up to 32.8{\%}.},

  Abstract                 = {CONTEXT: To date, it is unclear which measure of obesity is the most appropriate for risk stratification. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the associations of various measures of obesity with incident cardiovascular events and mortality. DESIGN AND SETTING: We analyzed two German cohort studies, the DETECT study and SHIP, including primary care and general population. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6355 (mean follow-up, 3.3 yr) and 4297 (mean follow-up, 8.5 yr) individuals participated in DETECT and SHIP, respectively. INTERVENTIONS: We measured body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and assessed cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of incident stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: In both studies, we found a positive association of the composite endpoint with WHtR but not with BMI. There was no heterogeneity among studies. The relative risks in the highest versus the lowest sex- and age-specific quartile of WHtR, WC, WHR, and BMI after adjustment for multiple confounders were as follows in the pooled data: cardiovascular mortality, 2.75 (95{\%} confidence interval, 1.31-5.77), 1.74 (0.84-3.6), 1.71 (0.91-3.22), and 0.74 (0.35-1.57), respectively; all-cause mortality, 1.86 (1.25-2.76), 1.62 (1.22-2.38), 1.36 (0.93-1.69), and 0.77 (0.53-1.13), respectively; and composite endpoint, 2.16 (1.39-3.35), 1.59 (1.04-2.44), 1.49 (1.07-2.07), and 0.57 (0.37-0.89), respectively. Separate analyses of sex and age groups yielded comparable results. Receiver operating characteristics analysis yielded the highest areas under the curve for WHtR for predicting these endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: WHtR represents the best predictor of cardiovascular risk and mortality, followed by WC and WHR. Our results discourage the use of the BMI.},

Then the position and height are measured in the scene space. In addition, geometric error caused by inaccurate projective mapping is corrected by using geometric constraints provided by the marker. The accuracy and robustness are verified on the experimental results of several video sequences from outdoor environments.},

The tissues are endowed with a highly nonlinear constitutive model including controllable anisotropic muscle activations based on fiber directions. Detailed models of this sort can be difficult to animate requiring complex coordinated stimulation of the underlying musculature. We propose a solution to this problem automatically determining muscle activations that track a sparse set of surface landmarks, e.g. acquired from motion capture marker data. Since the resulting animation is obtained via a three dimensional nonlinear finite element method, we obtain visually plausible and anatomically correct deformations with spatial and temporal coherence that provides robustness against outliers in the motion capture data. Moreover, the obtained muscle activations can be used in a robust simulation framework including contact and collision of the face with external objects.},

  Abstract                 = {Predicting human occupations in photos has great application potentials in intelligent services and systems. However, using traditional classification methods cannot reliably distinguish different occupations due to the complex relations between occupations and the low-level image features. In this paper, we investigate the human occupation prediction problem by modeling the appearances of human clothing as well as surrounding context. The human clothing, regarding its complex details and variant appearances, is described via part-based modeling on the automatically aligned patches of human body parts. The image patches are represented with semantic-level patterns such as clothes and haircut styles using methods based on sparse coding towards informative and noise-tolerant capacities. This description of human clothing is proved to be more effective than traditional methods. Different kinds of surrounding context are also investigated as a complementarity of human clothing features in the cases that the background information is available. Experiments are conducted on a well labeled image database that contains more than 5; 000 images from 20 representative occupation categories. The preliminary study shows the human occupation is reasonably predictable using the proposed clothing features and possible context.},

  Abstract                 = {A longstanding question in computer vision concerns the representation of 3D objects for shape recognition: should 3D objects be represented with shape descriptors operating on their native 3D format, such as their voxel grid or polygon mesh, or can they be effectively represented with view-based descriptors? We address this question in the context of learning to recognize 3D objects from a collection of their rendered views on 2D images. We first present a standard CNN architecture trained to recognize the objects' rendered views independently of each other. Starting from such a network, we show that a 3D object can be recognized even from a single view at an accuracy far higher than using state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors. The same architecture can be applied to accurately recognize human hand-drawn sketches of objects. Recognition rates further increase when multiple views of the objects are provided. In addition, we present a novel CNN architecture that combines information from multiple views of a 3D object into a single and compact shape descriptor offering even better recognition performance. We conclude that a collection of 2D views can be highly informative for 3D object recognition and is amenable to emerging CNN architectures and their derivatives.},

  Abstract                 = {Object viewpoint estimation from 2D images is an essential task in computer vision. However, two issues hinder its progress: scarcity of training data with viewpoint annotations, and a lack of powerful features. Inspired by the growing availability of 3D models, we propose a framework to address both issues by combining render-based image synthesis and CNNs. We believe that 3D models have the potential in generating a large number of images of high variation, which can be well exploited by deep CNN with a high learning capacity. Towards this goal, we propose a scalable and overfit-resistant image synthesis pipeline, together with a novel CNN specifically tailored for the viewpoint estimation task. Experimentally, we show that the viewpoint estimation from our pipeline can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL 3D+ benchmark.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognizing object classes and their 3D viewpoints is an important problem in computer vision. Based on a part-based probabilistic representation [31], we propose a new 3D object class model that is capable of recognizing unseen views by pose estimation and synthesis. We achieve this by using a dense, multiview representation of the viewing sphere parameterized by a triangular mesh of viewpoints. Each triangle of viewpoints can be morphed to synthesize new viewpoints. By incorporating 3D geometrical constraints, our model establishes explicit correspondences among object parts across viewpoints. We propose an incremental learning algorithm to train the generative model. A cellphone video clip of an object is first used to initialize model learning. Then the model is updated by a set of unsorted training images without viewpoint labels. We demonstrate the robustness of our model on object detection, viewpoint classification and synthesis tasks. Our model performs superiorly to and on par with state-of-the-art algorithms on the Savarese et al. 2007 and PASCAL datasets in object detection. It outperforms all previous work in viewpoint classification and offers promising results in viewpoint synthesis.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a novel point signature based on the properties of the heat diffusion process on a shape. Our signature, called the Heat Kernel Signature (or HKS), is obtained by restricting the well-known heat kernel to the temporal domain. Remarkably we show that under certain mild assumptions, HKS captures all of the information contained in the heat kernel, and characterizes the shape up to isometry. This means that the restriction to the temporal domain, on the one hand, makes HKS much more concise and easily commensurable, while on the other hand, it preserves all of the information about the intrinsic geometry of the shape. In addition, HKS inherits many useful properties from the heat kernel, which means, in particular, that it is stable under perturbations of the shape. Our signature also provides a natural and efficiently computable multi-scale way to capture information about neighborhoods of a given point, which can be extremely useful in many applications. To demonstrate the practical relevance of our signature, we present several methods for non-rigid multi-scale matching based on the HKS and use it to detect repeated structure within the same shape and across a collection of shapes.},

A generative framework is used for learning a model that captures the relative position of parts within each of the discretized viewpoints. Contrary to most of the existing mixture of viewpoints models, our model establishes explicit correspondences of parts across different viewpoints of the object class. Given a new image, detection and classification are achieved by determining the position and viewpoint of the model that maximize recognition scores of the candidate objects. Our approach is among the first to propose a generative probabilistic framework for 3D object categorization. We test our algorithm on the detection task and the viewpoint classification task by using ldquocarrdquo category from both the Savarese et al. 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2006 datasets.

In this paper, we investigate gender recognition using 3-D human body shapes. The 3-D human body shapes used for gender recognition were obtained by laser scanning. Different machine-learning algorithms and feature-extraction methods are investigated and analyzed in this paper. Experimental results show that the support vector machine (SVM) is the best classification algorithm, and the features represented using distributions of normals are very effective for gender recognition. Furthermore, Fourier descriptor (FD) is a robust method to analyze the breast regions and has great potential applications in 3-D human-body-shape-based biometrics. The research demonstrates that our shape-based gender recognition has achieved a very high recognition rate.

  Abstract                 = {Recent developments in techniques for modeling, digitizing and visualizing$\backslash$n3D shapes has led to an explosion in the number of available 3D models$\backslash$non the Internet and in domain-specific databases. This has led to$\backslash$nthe development of 3D shape retrieval systems that, given a query$\backslash$nobject, retrieve similar 3D objects. For visualization, 3D shapes$\backslash$nare often represented as a surface, in particular polygonal meshes,$\backslash$nfor example in VRML format. Often these models contain holes, intersecting$\backslash$npolygons, are not manifold, and do not enclose a volume unambiguously.$\backslash$nOn the contrary, 3D volume models, such as solid models produced$\backslash$nby CAD systems, or voxels models, enclose a volume properly. This$\backslash$npaper surveys the literature on methods for content based 3D retrieval,$\backslash$ntaking into account the applicability to surface models as well as$\backslash$nto volume models. The methods are evaluated with respect to several$\backslash$nrequirements of content based 3D shape retrieval, such as: (1) shape$\backslash$nrepresentation requirements, (2) properties of dissimilarity measures,$\backslash$n(3) efficiency, (4) discrimination abilities, (5) ability to perform$\backslash$npartial matching, (6) robustness, and (7) necessity of pose normalization.$\backslash$nFinally, the advantages and limits of the several approaches in content$\backslash$nbased 3D shape retrieval are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Relevance feedback schemes based on support vector machines (SVM) have been widely used in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). However, the performance of SVM-based relevance feedback is often poor when the number of labeled positive feedback samples is small. This is mainly due to three reasons: 1) an SVM classifier is unstable on a small-sized training set, 2) SVM's optimal hyperplane may be biased when the positive feedback samples are much less than the negative feedback samples, and 3) overfitting happens because the number of feature dimensions is much higher than the size of the training set. In this paper, we develop a mechanism to overcome these problems. To address the first two problems, we propose an asymmetric bagging-based SVM (AB-SVM). For the third problem, we combine the random subspace method and SVM for relevance feedback, which is named random subspace SVM (RS-SVM). Finally, by integrating AB-SVM and RS-SVM, an asymmetric bagging and random subspace SVM (ABRS-SVM) is built to solve these three problems and further improve the relevance feedback performance.},

In contrast to most existing systems which focus on a single viewpoint or aspect, our approach can detect object instances from arbitrary viewpoints. This is achieved by combining the Implicit Shape Model for object class detection proposed by Leibe and Schiele with the multi-view specific object recognition system of Ferrari et al. After learning single-view codebooks, these are interconnected by so-called activation links, obtained through multi-view region tracks across different training views of individual object instances. During recognition, these integrated codebooks work together to determine the location and pose of the object. Experimental results demonstrate the viability of the approach and compare it to a bank of independent single-view detectors},

  Abstract                 = {The Bayesian evidence framework has been successfully applied to the design of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in the work of MacKay. Nevertheless, the training of MLPs suffers from drawbacks like the nonconvex optimization problem and the choice of the number of hidden units. In support vector machines (SVMs) for classification, as introduced by Vapnik, a nonlinear decision boundary is obtained by mapping the input vector first in a nonlinear way to a high-dimensional kernel-induced feature space in which a linear large margin classifier is constructed. Practical expressions are formulated in the dual space in terms of the related kernel function, and the solution follows from a (convex) quadratic programming (QP) problem. In least-squares SVMs (LS-SVMs), the SVM problem formulation is modified by introducing a least-squares cost function and equality instead of inequality constraints, and the solution follows from a linear system in the dual space. Implicitly, the least-squares formulation corresponds to a regression formulation and is also related to kernel Fisher discriminant analysis. The least-squares regression formulation has advantages for deriving analytic expressions in a Bayesian evidence framework, in contrast to the classification formulations used, for example, in gaussian processes (GPs). The LS-SVM formulation has clear primal-dual interpretations, and without the bias term, one explicitly constructs a model that yields the same expressions as have been obtained with GPs for regression. In this article, the Bayesian evidence framework is combined with the LS-SVM classifier formulation. Starting from the feature space formulation, analytic expressions are obtained in the dual space on the different levels of Bayesian inference, while posterior class probabilities are obtained by marginalizing over the model parameters. Empirical results obtained on 10 public domain data sets show that the LS-SVM classifier designed within the Bayesian evidence framework consistently yields good generalization performances.},

  Abstract                 = {Maji and Berg have recently introduced an explicit feature map approximating the intersection kernel. This enables efficient learning methods for linear kernels to be applied to the non-linear intersection kernel, expanding the applicability of this model to much larger problems. In this paper we generalize this idea, and analyse a large family of additive kernels, called homogeneous, in a unified framework. The family includes the intersection, Hellinger's, and {\&}{\#}x03C7;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} kernels commonly employed in computer vision. Using the framework we are able to: (i) provide explicit feature maps for all homogeneous additive kernels along with closed form expression for all common kernels; (ii) derive corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature maps based on the Fourier sampling theorem; and (iii) quantify the extent of the approximation. We demonstrate that the approximations have indistinguishable performance from the full kernel on a number of standard datasets, yet greatly reduce the train/test times of SVM implementations. We show that the {\&}{\#}x03C7;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} kernel, which has been found to yield the best performance in most applications, also has the most compact feature representation. Given these train/test advantages we are able to obtain a significant performance improvement over current state of the art results based on the intersection kernel.},

  Abstract                 = {Weight is a biometric trait which has been already studied in both the forensic and medical domains. In many practical situations, such as videosurveillance, weight can provide useful information for re-identification purposes but needs to be estimated from visual appearance (images or video). In this work we study the feasibility of weight estimation from anthropome{\&}{\#}x0301;trie data directly accessible from the available image material. A model is retrieved via multiple regression analysis on a set of anthropome{\&}{\#}x0301;trie features. A large medical database is exploited for the model training, while its validation is performed both on ideal and realistic conditions. The performance analysis of our approach shows that under noisy data conditions the system provides accurate estimations, putting the basis for a future work towards an automatic weight estimation.},

Our application extrapo-lates anthropometric measures from the body silhouette and 3D information. Measures are used to estimate body weight thanks to a statistical model trained on the data of a large medical database. Thanks to the knowledge acquired while analyzing the user, the system provides through its interface, healthiness measures and informa-tion that are necessary for a correct lifestyle that would mitigate the effects of weight problems.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The first is the introduction of a new image representation called the "integral image" which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classifiers in a "cascade" which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object specific focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the common problem of testing the equality of means in a repeated measures design. Recent results indicate that practical problems can arise when computing confidence intervals for all pairwise differences of the means in conjunction with the Bonferroni inequality. This suggests, and is confirmed here, that a problem might occur when performing an omnibus test of equal means. The problem is that the probability of rejecting is not minimized when the means are equal and the usual univariate F test is used with the Huynh-Feldt correction (epsilon) for the degrees of freedom. That is, power can actually decrease as the mean of one group is lowered, although eventually it increases. A similar problem is found when using a multivariate method (Hotelling's T2). Moreover, the probability of a Type I error can exceed the nominal level by a large amount. The paper considers methods for correcting this problem, and new results on comparing trimmed means are reported as well. In terms of both Type I errors and power, simulations reported here suggest that a percentile t bootstrap used with 20{\%} trimmed means and an analogue of the epsilon-adjusted F gives the best results. This is consistent with extant theoretical results comparing methods based on means with trimmed means.},

Traditional research on gender recognition focuses on face images in a constrained environment. This paper proposes a method for gender recognition in articulated human body images acquired from an unconstrained environment in the real world. A systematic study of some critical issues in body-based gender recognition, such as which body parts are informative, how many body parts are needed to combine together, and what representations are good for articulated body-based gender recognition, is also presented. This paper also pursues data fusion schemes and efficient feature dimensionality reduction based on the partial least squares estimation. Extensive experiments are performed on two unconstrained databases which have not been explored before for gender recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Scene categorization is a fundamental problem in computer vision. However, scene understanding research has been constrained by the limited scope of currently-used databases which do not capture the full variety of scene categories. Whereas standard databases for object categorization contain hundreds of different classes of objects, the largest available dataset of scene categories contains only 15 classes. In this paper we propose the extensive Scene UNderstanding (SUN) database that contains 899 categories and 130,519 images. We use 397 well-sampled categories to evaluate numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for scene recognition and establish new bounds of performance. We measure human scene classification performance on the SUN database and compare this with computational methods. Additionally, we study a finer-grained scene representation to detect scenes embedded inside of larger scenes.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we investigate the performance of different types of rectified activation functions in convolutional neural network: standard rectified linear unit (ReLU), leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU), parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) and a new randomized leaky rectified linear units (RReLU). We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task. Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart. By using RReLU, we achieved 75.68$\backslash${\%} accuracy on CIFAR-100 test set without multiple test or ensemble.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a novel object class detection method based on 3D object modeling is presented. Instead of using a complicated mechanism for relating multiple 2D training views, the proposed method establishes spatial connections between these views by mapping them directly to the surface of 3D model. The 3D shape of an object is reconstructed by using a homographic framework from a set of model views around the object and is represented by a volume consisting of binary slices. Features are computed in each 2D model view and mapped to the 3D shape model using the same homographic framework. To generalize the model for object class detection, features from supplemental views are also considered. A codebook is constructed from all of these features and then a 3D feature model is built. Given a 2D test image, correspondences between the 3D feature model and the testing view are identified by matching the detected features. Based on the 3D locations of the corresponding features, several hypotheses of viewing planes can be made. The one with the highest confidence is then used to detect the object using feature location matching. Performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by using the PASCAL VOC challenge dataset and promising results are demonstrated.},

Using these isometries, we are able to explicitly describe the geodesics, first in the parametric case, then by modding out the parametrization and considering horizontal vectors. We also compute the sectional curvature for these spaces, and show, in particular, that the space of closed curves modulo rotation and change of parameter has positive curvature. Experimental results that explicitly compute minimizing geodesics between two closed curves are finally provided.},

It only requires the camera to observe a planar pattern shown at a few (at least two) different orientations. Either the camera or the planar pattern can be freely moved. The motion need not be known. Radial lens distortion is modeled. The proposed procedure consists of a closed-form solution, followed by a nonlinear refinement based on the maximum likelihood criterion. Both computer simulation and real data have been used to test the proposed technique and very good results have been obtained. Compared with classical techniques which use expensive equipment such as two or three orthogonal planes, the proposed technique is easy to use and flexible. It advances 3D computer vision one more step from laboratory environments to real world use.},

  Abstract                 = {Many recommendation systems suggest items to users by utilizing the techniques of collaborative filtering (CF) based on historical records of items that the users have viewed, purchased, or rated. Two major problems that most CF approaches have to contend with are scalability and sparseness of the user profiles. To tackle these issues, in this paper, we describe a CF algorithm alternating-least-squares with weighted- -regularization (ALS-WR), which is implemented on a parallel Matlab platform. We show empirically that the performance of ALS-WR (in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE)) monotonically improves with both the number of features and the number of ALS iterations. We applied the ALS-WR algorithm on a large-scale CF problem, the Netflix Challenge, with 1000 hidden features and obtained a RMSE score of 0.8985, which is one of the best results based on a pure method. In addition, combining with the parallel version of other known methods, we achieved a performance improvement of 5.91{\%} over Netflixs own CineMatch recommendation system. Our method is simple and scales well to very large datasets.},
